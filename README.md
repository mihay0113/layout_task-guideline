**IMPORTANT !!!!!!!** 
> Do NOT place your projects folder on desktop (To avoid permissions issues).
> It is better to put it into `D:\projects` or `C:\Users\YourName\projects`.
> But there should not be spaces in the path like this `C:\Users\Your Name\projects`.

1. Open the project on Github and **Fork** the repo.

     - At this point you should see the starting markup of the page at `http://localhost:8080/` opened in your Google Chrome
     - Add some text to `src/index.html`. The change should be immediately updated in the browser.
     - If the page is not updated automatically press `ctrl + r` (`cmd + r` for macOS)
   </details>

   <details>
     <summary>If the page is empty after you added some text</summary>
   
     - Update the page by pressing `ctrl + r` (`cmd + r` for macOS)
     - If the page is still empty check if you saved the changes ![Autosave is disabled](./images/autosave-is-disabled.png)
     - Enable autosave ![Enable autosave](./images/enable-autosave.png)
   </details>
   
   <details>
     <summary>If the page is opened at the other port (not :8080)</summary>
   
     - If you see the other port ![Wrong port](./images/wrong-server-port.png)
     - It means you already have another terminal running `npm start` command (maybe it is another project)
     - Stop the `npm start` command in current terminal by pressing `ctrl + c` (all operating systems)
     - Close the other terminal running `npm start`
     - Run the command again for your current project
     - The URL should be now `http://localhost:8080/`
     - If the URL is still wrong, just restart the computer
   </details>

7. Open one more terminal for the next steps.
   <details>
     <summary>Show the screenshot</summary>
   
     ![Open one more terminal](./images/open-one-more-terminal.png)
   </details>

   <details>
     <summary>If you see that develop already exists</summary>
   
     ![Develop already exists](./images/develop-already-exists.png)
     - run `git branch` to see all existent branches ![Show git branches](./images/show-git-branch.png)
     - If `develop` is marked with `*` then everything is correct
     - Otherwise, run `git checkout develop` (without `-b` key) ![Switch to develop](./images/switch-to-develop.png)
   </details>

9. Open `readme.md` file and replace a text `<your_account>` with your Github username in the `DEMO LINK` and `TEST REPORT LINK`
   <details>
     <summary>Example</summary>
   
     ![Update demo link](./images/update-demo-link.png)
   </details>

10. Implement the task described in `readme.md`. 
    - You should write the code in `index.html` and other files inside `src` folder.
    
11. Run `npm run lint` to check the code style.
    <details>
      <summary>If you have some errors</summary>

      - Fix all the errors and run the command again

      ![Linter errors](./images/linter-errors.png)

      ![HTML autoformat json](./images/html-autoformat-json.png)
    </details>

12. To check if your solution matches all the expectations you can run `npm test`
    - If test results are not opened in a browser, check if you fixed all the code style errors (`npm run lint`)
    - If you can't run tests for some weird reason just use a screenshot from
      `backstop_data/bitmaps_reference/Entire_document.png` to ensure your page looks as expected.

    <details>
      <summary>If you see a failing test</summary>

      - Run `npm test` again to see the results
    </details>

13. Save your changes `git commit -am 'some message'`

18. Check your work using checklist (look for it in the root directory of the project) before submitting it for review.
19. To update you PR repeat steps 10-15 (no need to create the PR one more time).

scripts work without `sudo`. Correct permissions mean you don't see errors like
`permission denied` after running commands in terminal.

## NPM commands
- `npm install` installs the project dependencies and runs `postinstall`
  - which create reference files for pixel perfect and tests 
- `npm start` runs the server required for development and tests
- `npm test` runs linter and tests
  - `npm run lint` runs linter (code style check)
  - `npm run test:only` runs pixel perfect tests
